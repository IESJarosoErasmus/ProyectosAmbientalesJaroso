Welcome to the IES Jaroso page on Environmental Projects carried out by the Department of Laboratory Operations with the technological collaboration of the Department of Information Technology.
  
We are going to collect all the projects that we have carried out to raise awareness about environmental issues located in the region in which we are located.

The objectives that we pursue with all these projects are:
- Promote and develop the interest of FP students in Environmental Sciences.
- Promote environmental awareness among young people, as well as make them appreciate the fundamental role of knowledge in the conservation of the environment and the sustainable development of the planet.
- Strengthen the relationships between the vocational training students of the center and with students from other centers, encouraging collaboration with the training tasks of their teachers.
- Support the development of transversal oral and written communication skills, a critical sense and the ability of students to work in a team, which will help them to approach their vocational training studies with greater confidence and their subsequent integration into the labor market.
