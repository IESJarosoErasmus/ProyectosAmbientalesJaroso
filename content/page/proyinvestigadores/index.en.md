From the CFGM of Laboratory Operations we consider it very important that students seek their sources of inspiration and motivation to complete their personal and professional development. A motivating and interesting activity for everyone is learning about the work carried out by researchers, as well as their laboratories, the techniques they use and their communication and dissemination capabilities of the results. From the department we plan virtual and face-to-face visits to research centers and we share a moment of chat and debate with the responsible researchers.
The first of these events was developed with the kind collaboration of the researcher Sonia Albein Urios from the AIMPLAS Institute of Valencia, in which we learned about her recent research in relation to microplastics and about the recycling, recovery and management of waste.
