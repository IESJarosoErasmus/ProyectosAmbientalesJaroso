Students and teachers of our training program were able to enjoy a week of linguistic immersion activities in Ireland. Our goals were to promote international mobility for our students and improve their language skills. Additionally, we always consider how to enhance the quality of the training we offer at our center and how to better align vocational training with the labor market needs within our professional field.

The labor market increasingly demands profiles with skills and abilities in teamwork, communication qualities, leadership capacity, and the development of critical thinking.

All the activities we carry out in the bilingual English classroom of the Intermediate Level Vocational Training Program in Laboratory Operations are funded by the Ministry of Education, Vocational Training and Sports, and by the European Union - NextGeneration EU.
