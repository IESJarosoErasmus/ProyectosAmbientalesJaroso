**Visit of Vocational Education Students from France to IES Jaroso in Cuevas del Almanzora: An Enriching Exchange Under the Erasmus+ Program** 

During a week, IES Jaroso in Cuevas del Almanzora had the honor of welcoming a group of vocational training laboratory students from Valenciennes (France), specifically from Lyc√©e de l'Escaut, as part of an academic exchange within the Erasmus+ program. This visit, rich in professional and cultural experiences, aimed to strengthen ties between vocational training centers from different countries, promoting international collaboration and shared learning.  

The program was structured around a series of activities combining technical, cultural, and leisure aspects. The French students had the opportunity to share knowledge and practices with their counterparts at IES Jaroso, allowing for a mutual understanding of vocational training approaches in both countries. Through this interaction, we were able to compare and enrich our professional experiences, gaining new perspectives on the methodologies and technologies we can implement. We would like to highlight the cultural dimension of the program, which allowed us to forge personal and professional bonds, fostering the creation of an international network of contacts that could be beneficial for students' future careers and personal growth.  

This visit is an excellent example of the benefits that the Erasmus+ program provides, not only in academic terms but also in personal development and in building connections across generations and cultures. Undoubtedly, this experience has left a positive impact on all participants and has reaffirmed IES Jaroso's commitment to internationalization and educational excellence.
